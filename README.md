After attending multiple music festivals, my friends and I wanted an easy way to listen to the music of multiple specific artists to prepare for seeing them live. 

This inspired my Spotify Playlist Builder: built with Spotify Web API, React, Node.js, and Express.js.

The app allows you to enter a list of artists, a number (max 10), and a playlist title, and creates a playlist with that top number of songs from each artist.

Learned:
- spotify authorization code flow
- Access token refresh
- Javascript frameworks and general full MERN stack


Found a small bug in Spotify API which was cool!
